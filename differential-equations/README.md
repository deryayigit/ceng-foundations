# Differential Equations

A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives.

Understanding differential equations is essential for analyzing and interpreting many types of problems such as fluid motion, electric current in circuits, heat transfer in solid objects, detection of seismic waves, population growth or decline, and many similar phenomena.

Differential equations represent physical models and are referred to as mathematical models. The main purpose of solving differential equations is to gain insight into the mathematical model that expresses a physical process. Understanding a complex and natural process often involves reducing it to its simplest form. Hence, to comprehend the equations that describe these models and their solutions, we must first be familiar with their simpler versions.

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is one in which the unknown function depends on only one independent variable. If the unknown function depends on two or more independent variables, the differential equation is called a partial differential equation (PDE).

The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative appearing in the equation.

# Notation

The expressions \( y', y'', y''', y^{(4)}, \ldots, y^{(n)} \) are commonly used to represent the first, second, third, fourth, ..., nth derivatives of a function \( y \) with respect to the independent variable.

For example:
- If the independent variable is \( x \), then \( y'' = \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \)
- If the independent variable is \( p \), then \( y'' = \frac{d^2y}{dp^2} \)

Parentheses in \( y^{(n)} \) are used to distinguish it from the nth power \( y^n \).

When the independent variable is time (usually denoted by \( t \)), primes are often replaced by dots:
- \( \dot{y} = \frac{dy}{dt} \)
- \( \ddot{y} = \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} \)
- \( \dddot{y} = \frac{d^3y}{dt^3} \)

# History of Differential Equations

The study of differential equations began in the seventeenth century with Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Newton classified first-order equations and developed series methods for solutions, while Leibniz introduced the derivative and integral notation and the method of separation of variables.

The Bernoulli family expanded the field: Jakob and Johann contributed new methods and solved important problems such as the brachistochrone, while Daniel Bernoulli applied partial differential equations to fluid mechanics.

Leonhard Euler made fundamental contributions, including integrating factors, general solutions for linear equations with constant coefficients, and numerical methods. Joseph-Louis Lagrange advanced the theory with the variation of parameters method and showed how higher-order solutions are combinations of independent solutions. Pierre-Simon Laplace introduced equations central to mathematical physics and the Laplace transform.

In the nineteenth century, existence and uniqueness theorems were established, and partial differential equations became central to physics. In the twentieth century, numerical methods gained importance, and with the rise of computers, nonlinear systems could be studied more effectively. Modern approaches also include geometric and topological perspectives to understand the qualitative behavior of solutions.

# In Short

Differential equations began with Newton and Leibniz, were developed by the Bernoulli family, Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace, enriched in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with theoretical and numerical methods, and in the modern era have reached far wider applications thanks to computers.
