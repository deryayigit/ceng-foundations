# Differential Equations

A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives.

Understanding differential equations is essential for analyzing many types of problems such as fluid motion, electric current in circuits, heat transfer in solid objects, detection of seismic waves, population growth or decline, and many similar natural phenomena.

Differential equations represent physical processes and are therefore considered mathematical models. The main purpose of solving differential equations is to gain insight into these models. Understanding a complex natural process often requires reducing it to its simplest form. Hence, to comprehend the equations that describe these models and their solutions, one must first be familiar with simpler cases.

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) involves a function with only one independent variable. If the unknown function depends on two or more independent variables, the equation is called a partial differential equation (PDE).
