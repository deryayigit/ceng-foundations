A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives.

Therefore, understanding differential equations is essential for analyzing and interpreting many types of problems such as fluid motion, electric current in circuits, heat transfer in solid objects, detection of seismic waves, population growth or decline, and many similar phenomena.

Differential equations represent physical models and are referred to as mathematical models. The main purpose of solving differential equations is to gain insight into the mathematical model that expresses a physical process. Understanding a complex and natural process often involves reducing it to its simplest form. Hence, to comprehend the equations that describe these models and their solutions, we must first be familiar with their simpler versions.

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is one in which the unknown function depends on only one independent variable. If the unknown function depends on two or more independent variables, the differential equation is called a partial differential equation (PDE).

The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative appearing in the equation.

# Notation

The expressions `y'`, `y''`, `y'''`, `y^(4)`, …, `y^(n)` are often used to represent, respectively, 
the first, second, third, fourth, …, nth derivatives of `y` with respect to the independent variable 
under consideration. 

Thus, `y''` represents `d^2y/dx^2` if the independent variable is `x`, but `d^2y/dp^2` if the independent 
variable is `p`. 

Observe that parentheses are used in `y^(n)` to distinguish it from the nth power `y^n`. 

If the independent variable is time, usually denoted by `t`, primes are often replaced by dots. 
Thus, `ẏ`, `ÿ`, and `y⃛` represent `dy/dt`, `d^2y/dt^2`, and `d^3y/dt^3`, respectively.
