# Algorithms Basics Directory 

This directory contains implementations of fundamental mathematical and logical algorithms in C.

## Files

- [**armstrong_number.c**](./armstrong_number.c)  
  Checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also called narcissistic number).  
  Example: 153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153 → Armstrong number.

- [**factorial_iterative.c**](./factorial_iterative.c)  
  Computes the factorial of a number using an **iterative (loop-based)** approach.  
  Example: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

- [**isleap.c**](./isleap.c)  
  Determines whether a given year is a **leap year** based on the Gregorian calendar rules.  
  Example: 2000 → Leap year, 1900 → Not a leap year.

- [**isperfect.c**](./isperfect.c)  
  Checks whether a number is a **perfect number** (sum of its proper divisors equals the number itself).  
  Example: 28 → 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 → Perfect number.

- [**isprime.c**](./isprime.c)  
  Tests whether a number is a **prime number**.  
  Example: 7 → Prime, 9 → Not prime.
