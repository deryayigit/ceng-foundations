# üîê Network Security

This document provides a concise overview of **Network Security** concepts, covering both fundamental and advanced security protocols, authentication mechanisms, and key management systems.

---

## 1. Public Key Cryptography
A cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: **public keys** (shared openly) and **private keys** (kept secret).  
It enables secure data transmission, digital signatures, and authentication.

---

## 2. Entity Authentication
Methods used to verify the identity of a communicating party.

- **Claimant:** The entity that needs to prove its identity.  
- **Verifier:** The entity that checks and confirms the claimant‚Äôs identity.

---

## 3. Data Origin vs. Entity Authentication
- **Data Origin Authentication:** Ensures the authenticity of the *source* of the data.  
- **Entity Authentication:** Ensures the *identity* of the sender.  
- **Difference:** Data integrity vs. user identity verification.

---

## 4. Verification Categories
- **Knowledge-based authentication** (password, PIN)  
- **Possession-based authentication** (smart card, token)  
- **Biometric-based authentication** (fingerprint, facial recognition)

---

## 5. Password Systems

### ‚Ä¢ Fixed Password
- Static passwords used repeatedly.  
- **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to brute-force and dictionary attacks.  
- **Enhancements:** Use of *salting*, *hashing*, and *multi-factor authentication (MFA)*.

---

## 6. Cryptographic Hash Functions
- Ensure **data integrity**.  
- Are **one-way** functions ‚Äî impossible to reverse.  
- The same input always produces the same hash output.

### ‚Ä¢ SHA-512
- Produces a 512-bit output.  
- Provides high security.  
- Widely used in modern encryption protocols.

---

## 7. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
A concept of proving knowledge **without revealing the information itself**.  
> ‚ÄúI can prove that I know something without showing what it is.‚Äù

Used in privacy-preserving and authentication systems.

### Protocols:
- **Fiat‚ÄìShamir Protocol**

- **Feige‚ÄìFiat‚ÄìShamir Protocol**

- **Guillou‚ÄìQuisquater Protocol**

---

## 8. Biometrics
- Authentication through physical characteristics such as fingerprints, iris scans, or facial recognition.  
- Provides higher security but raises **privacy** and **data protection** concerns.

---

## 9. Key Management
Covers the **generation**, **distribution**, **renewal**, and **revocation** of cryptographic keys.

- **KDC (Key Distribution Center):** Centralized system for key distribution.  
- **Kerberos:** An authentication protocol based on KDC architecture.

### KDC-Based Protocols
- **Needham‚ÄìSchroeder Protocol**

- **Otway‚ÄìRees Protocol**

- **Kerberos Protocol**

---

## 10. Diffie‚ÄìHellman (DH) Key Exchange
- Allows two parties to generate a shared secret key.  
- Enables secure communication *without transmitting the key itself.*  
- Based on modular exponential mathematics.

## 11. ElGamal Algorithm
- Asymmetric encryption algorithm.  
- Based on the Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange principle.  
- Ensures secure message encryption and decryption.
