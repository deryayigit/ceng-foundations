## Basic Concepts

### Continuous Signal
A signal that is continuous in time and can take any value at any moment.  
Example: Audio waveform, analog temperature sensor output.

### Discrete Signal
A discrete signal is a sequence of values obtained by **sampling a continuous signal at uniform intervals in time**. Each sample represents the amplitude of the signal at that specific time. Discrete signals are typically processed digitally using algorithms such as **DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform)**, filters, or difference equations.

**Summary:**  
A discrete signal is simply a **sequence of sampled values from a continuous signal** and should not be confused with specific analysis techniques applied to it.


### Mean (μ)
Represents the central value of a dataset.

### Variance (σ²)
Indicates how much the data deviates from the mean.

### Standard Deviation (σ)
The square root of the variance; used to understand data spread.

# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Overview

# Digitization of Continuous Signals

A continuous signal is digitized by passing it through an **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**, allowing real-world data to be transferred into the digital domain.

The discretization of the continuous signal from the ADC occurs along the **x** and **y** axes:

- **Sampling**: Discretization along the x-axis (time axis).  
- **Quantization**: Discretization along the y-axis (amplitude axis).

In the digital conversion process:

- Losses along the x-axis are called **sampling noise** or **aliasing**.  
- Losses along the y-axis are called **noise** or **quantization error**.

To reduce these losses, the number of samples should be increased. However, while increasing the number of samples up to a certain point improves conversion quality, excessive sampling can lead to **inefficiency** and **higher costs**.
