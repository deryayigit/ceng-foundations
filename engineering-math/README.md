# üìò Engineering Math Fundamentals

This repository is a study guide and reference for core mathematical and signal-processing concepts widely used in engineering disciplines. It is ideal for students, educators, and professionals looking to strengthen their understanding of topics like Fourier analysis, signal transformation, and digital data conversion.

## üìÇ Topics Covered

### 1. Fourier Series
The Fourier Series represents periodic signals as infinite sums of sines and cosines. It is foundational for signal analysis in electrical engineering, control systems, and communications.

- **Concepts:**
  - Periodic functions
  - Orthogonality of sine and cosine functions
  - Coefficients \( a_0, a_n, b_n \)
  - Even and odd function decomposition
- **Applications:**
  - Signal filtering
  - Harmonic analysis
  - System response to periodic inputs

### 2. Fourier Transform
The Fourier Transform generalizes the Fourier Series for non-periodic signals, enabling frequency domain analysis of arbitrary waveforms.

- **Concepts:**
  - Continuous-Time Fourier Transform (CTFT)
  - Frequency spectrum
  - Time-frequency duality
  - Convolution and filtering
- **Applications:**
  - Image and audio processing
  - Spectral analysis
  - Communication systems

### 3. AD/DA (Analog to Digital and Digital to Analog Conversion)
Essential in digital signal processing, AD/DA covers the conversion between continuous and discrete signal forms.

- **Concepts:**
  - Sampling Theorem (Nyquist)
  - Quantization and resolution
  - DAC architectures (e.g., R-2R ladder)
  - Signal reconstruction
- **Applications:**
  - Digital audio
  - Embedded systems
  - Sensor data acquisition

### 4. Digital RAM ADC
This refers to digital data storage in conjunction with analog-to-digital conversion.

- **Concepts:**
  - Successive Approximation Register (SAR)
  - Flash and Sigma-Delta ADCs
  - Memory interfacing with ADCs
  - Sample-and-hold circuits
- **Applications:**
  - Real-time data logging
  - Microcontroller systems
  - Digital instrumentation
