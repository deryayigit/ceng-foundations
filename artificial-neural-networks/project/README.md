# 🧠 Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project is prepared for **BIL4015 Artificial Neural Networks course**.  
It demonstrates **single-layer** and **multi-layer supervised learning** models, including implementation, training, testing, and update processes.  

---

## 📌 Project Scope
- **Single Layer Neural Network**
  - **Single Neuron**: Binary classification on 2D data using sigmoid activation.  
  - **Multi Neuron**: Multi-class classification on 2D data using sigmoid activation.  

- **Multi Layer Neural Network (MLP)**
  - Error backpropagation with **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** and **Momentum**.  
  - Training and testing update processes.  

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
- Custom code written without using high-level ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).  
- Includes **training**, **testing**, and **update** phases.  
- Structured as a **course project** with detailed documentation.
