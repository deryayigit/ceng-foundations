## Project Description

This assignment consists of two main topics that were explained in detail
both theoretically and practically during the lectures.

### 1. Single-Layer Neural Network

#### 1.1 Single Neuron
Supervised learning using a single neuron with a continuous activation
function on labeled samples belonging to two classes in a 2-dimensional
feature space.

#### 1.2 Multi Neuron
Supervised learning using multiple neurons with continuous activation
functions on labeled samples belonging to multiple classes in a
2-dimensional feature space.

### 2. Multi-Layer Neural Network

Supervised learning based on error back-propagation using Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) and Momentum on labeled samples belonging to
multiple classes in a 2-dimensional feature space.

Both training and testing update processes are explicitly implemented
and demonstrated.

---
## Implementation
Training and testing update processes are explicitly implemented and demonstrated in **C++**.
