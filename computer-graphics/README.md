## 💡 Lighting and Illumination  

- **Light Source Position**  
- **Diffuse Component**: Brightness varies depending on the angle of incidence of the light source.  
- **Specular Component**: Reflection of the light source on the object’s surface.  
- **Ambient Component**: Background light that ensures even shaded areas are illuminated.  

> **Note:** The viewpoint is usually taken as *(0,0,0)*.

## 🔦 Ray Tracing  

- Pixel coordinate calculation on the image plane:  

\[
GD(X,Y,Z) = \Big(16 \cdot \frac{x}{799} - 8,\ 4.5 - \frac{y \cdot 9}{449},\ 10\Big)
\]
