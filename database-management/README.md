## 🔍 Introduction

**Fundamentals of Database Management** focuses on how data is structured, manipulated, and stored efficiently using modern database systems.

---

## 🧩 Reasons for the Emergence of Databases

This section covers the limitations of traditional file systems and the evolution of databases to:
- Ensure data integrity
- Support concurrent access
- Avoid data redundancy
- Centralize data management

---

## 🗃️ Structured Query Language (SQL)

SQL is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. It allows users to:
- Query data
- Update records
- Create and delete tables
- Manage permissions

## 🧠 Important SQL Queries

Here you’ll find examples of widely-used SQL queries such as:
- `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- `JOIN` operations
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`

## 🔶 Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams

ER diagrams represent the logical structure of databases, illustrating:
- Entities
- Attributes
- Relationships

---

## 🧬 Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagrams

EER diagrams extend ER models by including:
- Subclasses/Superclasses
- Specialization and Generalization
- Categories
