# CENG Foundations

In this repo, I've worked on developing fundamental computer engineering concepts and their code using C and C++.

I've also tried to include my freelance work and individual projects. I primarily use C and C++, but I also include work in Python and C#.

Through this repository, I aimed to collect what I know collectively on an open source platform, where I can look back when I want to remember, and to share what I have learned on Github, which is an open source platform.
