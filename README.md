# CENG Foundations

This repository showcases the projects I developed during my Computer Engineering studies, reflecting the core knowledge I gained and my practical experience with problem-solving.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository can be considered as an independent project, similar to a standalone repository.  
However, I organized them under a single repository to provide a consolidated view of my coursework and projects.  

This way, you can explore each topic individually while still seeing the bigger picture of my Computer Engineering journey.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Languages
- **C, C++** – Primary focus for algorithms, data structures, and core projects  
- **Python, C#** – Used in select projects and experiments  
- **Core Computer Engineering Concepts** – Implemented through hands-on projects
- I selected the technology according to the needs and purpose.
