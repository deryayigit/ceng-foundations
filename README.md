# CENG Foundations

This repository showcases my academic and personal projects in Computer Engineering, focusing on practical implementations and problem-solving skills.

---

## Technologies & Languages
- **C, C++** – Primary focus for algorithms, data structures, and core projects
- **Python, C#** – Used in select projects and experiments
- **Core Computer Engineering Concepts** – Implemented through hands-on projects

---

## Project Highlights
This repository includes a wide range of projects from various Computer Engineering courses and personal explorations, including but not limited to:

- **Algorithms & Data Structures** – Implementations in C and C++.
- **Signal & Systems Projects** – Digital signal processing, system analysis, and simulations.
- **Image Processing** – Projects involving image transformations, filtering, and analysis.
- **Networking & Socket Programming** – Hands-on networking experiments and protocols.
- **Operating Systems & OOP** – Core OS concepts and object-oriented programming implementations.
- **Engineering Mathematics & Course Projects** – Numerical methods, simulations, and algorithmic exercises.
- **Freelance & Personal Experiments** – Tools and projects in Python, C#, and other explorations.

Each folder contains detailed instructions and code, allowing you to explore the implementations and learnings across different technical areas.

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to consolidate my knowledge, demonstrate practical skills, and share my learnings with the open-source community. You can review the work to see my projects in action.

---

## How to Explore
- Each folder contains a README with detailed instructions.
- Compile C/C++ projects using `g++` or `clang`.
- Python scripts can be run with Python 3.x.
- C# projects can be opened and run in Visual Studio.
