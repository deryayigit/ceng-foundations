# CENG Foundations

This repository contains projects and code developed to strengthen my fundamental computer engineering concepts using C and C++.

It also includes my freelance and individual projects. For implementation, I use C and C++ where appropriate, but there are also projects developed with Python and C#.

The goal of this repository is to organize my knowledge in one place and share my learnings with the open source community on GitHub.
