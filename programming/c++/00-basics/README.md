```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}

```

#include <iostream> → allows input/output functions

using namespace std; → enables use of standard library names directly

int main() → starting point of every C++ program

return 0; → indicates successful execution

C++ Identifiers

Identifiers are user-defined elements (variables, functions, classes, modules, etc.).

Naming rules:

Must begin with A–Z, a–z, or _.

Can contain letters, digits (0–9), and underscores after the first character.

Special characters (@, $, %, etc.) are not allowed.

Case-sensitive (gun and Gun are different identifiers).

Keywords are reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers.

Examples include:

if, else, for, int, float, char, unsigned, new, this, return, ...
