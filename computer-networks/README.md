# Computer Networks  

This repository covers the **fundamentals of Computer Networks**, including core concepts, devices, architectures, and standards. It aims to provide both **theoretical knowledge** and **practical understanding** of how networks operate.

## 🌐 What is the Internet?  
The Internet is a global system of interconnected devices that share resources and data.  

### Growth of the Internet  
- The exact size of the Internet cannot be measured precisely.  
- Estimates rely on IP-based addressing, since many devices connect through modem-assigned IPs.  
- MAC addresses are not used for global size estimations because they are unique only at the local network level.

## 🔌 Network Devices  
Devices that manage and support network functions, such as:  
- Routers  
- Switches  
- Hubs  
- Access Points  
- Firewalls

## 🕸️ Network Topologies  
Common structures used to connect devices:  
- Bus  
- Ring  
- Mesh  
- Star  
- Fully Connected  
- Line  
- Tree

## 🏗️ Layered Architectures  

Different technologies coexist and need to interoperate. The **layering concept** makes this possible and also easier to understand.  

1. **Internet Reference Model (TCP/IP Model)**  
2. **ISO OSI Reference Model**

## 📡 Transmission Media  

Data transmission varies according to the type of energy used:  
- Electrical signals (Copper cables)  
- Light (Optical fiber)  
- Electromagnetic waves (Wireless, radio frequency)

## 🌍 IP Addressing & Subnetting  

An **IP address** is the identity of every device connected to the Internet. It enables devices to deliver data to the correct destination.  

Types of IP addressing:  
- **Static IP** – Fixed, permanent address.  
- **Dynamic IP** – Assigned automatically, changes over time.

## 🏢 Networking Authorities  

To avoid chaos in the rapidly evolving networking field, international organizations establish standards:  

- **IETF** – Internet Engineering Task Force  
- **IEEE** – Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  
- **ITU-R** – International Telecommunication Union – Radiocommunication Sector  

These organizations define and maintain the rules and protocols used worldwide.
